                        Ms. Anuradha has been in the field of education for the past 40 years and from mentoring to curriculum setting to English Language Training and Communication Skills training… her aim has always been to upskill young people in order to join the country’s workforce.<br/><br/>
                        In aspirational India of the 21st Century, the role of any educational mentor or Institution should be to guide the youth towards being monetarily productive… both towards self and the country’s economy.<br/><br/>
ACRI, set up in the year 2010 under the aegis of Avigna Learning Academy, aims to train students from the Health Care and Life Sciences sector and place them in the recession-free Clinical Research Industry.<br/><br/>
Over the years, as a teacher and trainer Anuradha’s aim has been to sensitize her students towards goal-oriented education.<br/><br/>
From the year 2000 onwards, the focus in India shifted to professional courses and colleges set their curriculum to suit industrial requirements. With a boom in the IT sector, engineers were sought after and management graduates also found many takers in the industry. However, there was a huge gap between industry demand and employable graduates. The main reason was the complete lack of language and communication skills amongst young graduates.
In 2006, Avigna Learning Academy was set up by Anuradha to train young graduates to become employable. Right from curating their resumes and enhancing their communication and interview skills training at ALA included grooming tips and presentation skills.<br/><br/>
As a corporate trainer, Anuradha has trained more than 300 middle-level and senior-level executives: the main goal here also was to enable executives to grow in their chosen career paths.
