                CEO

              <p class="w-95 lg-w-95">
                Ms. Anuradha has been in the field of education for the past 40
                years and from mentoring to curriculum setting to English
                Language Training and Communication Skills training… her aim has
                always been to upskill young people in order to join the
                country’s workforce.
                <br />
                <br />
                In aspirational India of the 21st Century, the role of any
                educational mentor or Institution should be to guide the youth
                towards being monetarily productive… both towards self and the
                country’s economy.
                <br />
                <br />
                ACRI, set up in the year 2010 under the aegis of Avigna Learning
                Academy, aims to train students from the Health Care and Life
                Sciences sector and place them in the recession-free Clinical
                Research Industry.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the years, as a teacher and trainer Anuradha’s aim has been
                to sensitize her students towards goal-oriented education.
                <br />
                <br />
                From the year 2000 onwards, the focus in India shifted to
                professional courses and colleges set their curriculum to suit
                industrial requirements. With a boom in the IT sector, engineers
                were sought after and management graduates also found many
                takers in the industry. However, there was a huge gap between
                industry demand and employable graduates. The main reason was
                the complete lack of language and communication skills amongst
                young graduates. In 2006, Avigna Learning Academy was set up by
                Anuradha to train young graduates to become employable. Right
                from curating their resumes and enhancing their communication
                and interview skills training at ALA included grooming tips and
                presentation skills.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a corporate trainer, Anuradha has trained more than 300
                middle-level and senior-level executives: the main goal here
                also was to enable executives to grow in their chosen career
                paths.
