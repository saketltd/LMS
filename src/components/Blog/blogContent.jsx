                    Education, as we know it today, is taking a fluid shape and
                    size. It is now not just limited to thick textbooks and a
                    bag full of study material. The conventional model of
                    education is witnessing a transformation. This
                    transformation is being driven and directed keeping
                    technology at the helm. We see seminars, educational
                    meet-ups, conferences, parent-teacher meets, and classes
                    taking place over the internet. This said revolution has not
                    occurred overnight and is definitely not the final frontier
                    of what we today refer to as “Education Technology” or
                    “EdTech”.

                  To put it simply, EdTech or Education Technology is the
                  incorporation of technology into education. Varied mediums and
                  channels are utilized to share information, keeping the
                  learning aspect in the center. Lesson plans are no longer
                  lengthy process maps on papers, students’ inventory management
                  is not only limited to stocky record books and classes no
                  longer require the tangible presence, neither of the teacher
                  nor the student.

                  The world struggled (and it still is) to grapple with the
                  outbreak of the virus in the earlier half of 2020. The
                  pandemic changed the face and functioning of everything
                  “normal”. At such a volatile conjecture, continuing with the
                  customary means of education was off the cards. The collective
                  uncertainty of such times have compelled institutions to
                  resort to online modes of teaching. Be it Microsoft Teams,
                  Google Meet or Zoom, a considerable chunk of students &
                  teachers are observed trying to embrace the technological
                  shift. Since the most primary condition of the pandemic is to
                  avoid social meets and promote distancing, EdTech as a term
                  has now begun to take rounds all over the world.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  As humankind prepares to make the shift from offline to
                  online, there still are a few underlying challenges that need
                  to be addressed & shed light on. In order to have a
                  standardized approach towards online learning, we need to
                  first figure out the feasibility of tech tools being made
                  available for every learner. Provided proper addressal of the
                  said concern, EdTech has the potential to overtake the entire
                  model of learning as we have known, seen and accepted it
                  ourselves, during our times.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  Globally, the education and training industries combined
                  account for disbursing more than $4 trillion, showing an
                  immense increase since 2000 by a whopping 84 percent. Now
                  these are some big figures, aren’t they? We will try to see
                  the impact EdTech is projected to have, if it is adopted as a
                  globally standardized mode of learning.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  <strong> EdTech’s impact on Cost :</strong> We have seen that
                  the traditional system of learning consumes great deals of
                  resources. Material like paper, pen, ink, leather and a
                  multitude of other raw materials is expended in this mode.
                  This deems the traditional mode of learning inefficient,
                  considering the total cost of resources being spent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  An American survey highlighted that despite the huge spending
                  on resources, reading and maths scores have remained stagnant
                  and it is estimated that nearly 85% of every dollar spent on
                  education is spent on delivering it.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  However, cost effectiveness is not the exclusive driving force
                  in EdTech’s rise but it is an indispensably important factor
                  in considering high educational expenditure and educational
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  Revamped user engagement and scope for a bigger learning
                  impact Students have been responding well to newer methods of
                  learning. A number of factors have played a role in generating
                  and maintaining student engagement throughout the last couple
                  of years, as far as EdTech as a separate branch is concerned.
                  Gamification, multi-media based learning, casual mobile
                  learning apps and interactive learning platforms are creating
                  a major transition in the way content is presented & received;
                  it is getting immersive and seamless.
                </p>
                <p class="text-50">
                  Given the above factors, EdTech is not only significant in
                  shaping the way our future gen will be looking at education
                  but also for being ready for a constantly evolving, changing
                  and uncertain world.
