                    India is evolving in many phases to run the race in the
                    world; and Clinical Research is one such phase where India
                    is making remarkable development and growth. India has been
                    involved in clinical research for the past many years and is
                    now on its way to becoming a major focus for it. The billion
                    dollar industry is already witnessing high demand for
                    qualified professionals. Indian pharmaceutical industry is
                    one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy and
                    has made rapid strides over the years. There is a massive
                    need for clinical research professionals in this
                    fast-growing field. Clinical research makes an interesting
                    career option with a great scope for professional growth. To
                    build a career in clinical research, basic education in this
                    field is necessary and a good hands on is the need. <br />
                    <br /> By 2020, the Indian pharma market is expected to rank
                    among the global top three by increasing growth and is
                    supposed to be the 6th largest market in the world with
                    respect to absolute size. <br /> <br /> The term clinical
                    trial refers to the entire record of any test article from
                    its initiation in the lab to its introduction to the market
                    and beyond. Once the promising molecule is identified in the
                    lab, it is subjected to more per-clinical studies to get an
                    idea about different aspects of the test article. Clinical
                    research is often conducted at academic medical centers and
                    recognized research centers. <br />
                    <br /> Many believe that informed consent makes clinical
                    research ethical. However, informed consent is not
                    sufficient. Drawing on the basic philosophies there are some
                    requirements that systematically explain a logical framework
                    for evaluating the ethics of clinical research studies. The
                    requirements are universal and they must be adapted to the
                    various fields in which clinical research is conducted.

                    A CRO landscape is vast; using a CRO’s expertise you can
                    maximize the efficiency of your clinical trials, but only if
                    you choose the right one for the project at hand.Typically,
                    a CRO will organize and conduct clinical trials to check the
                    test molecule in humans. As independent companies, they
                    offer an objective assessment of a new drug in the clinical
                    setting and since they partner with many companies,
                    typically provide broader experience.

                    India is evolving in many phases to run the race in the
                    world; and Clinical Research is one such phase where India
                    is making remarkable development and growth. India has been
                    involved in clinical research for the past many years and is
                    now on its way to becoming a major focus for it. The billion
                    dollar industry is already witnessing high demand for
                    qualified professionals. Indian pharmaceutical industry is
                    one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy and
                    has made rapid strides over the years. There is a massive
                    need for clinical research professionals in this
                    fast-growing field. Clinical research makes an interesting
                    career option with a great scope for professional growth. To
                    build a career in clinical research, basic education in this
                    field is necessary and a good hands on is the need. <br />
                    <br /> By 2020, the Indian pharma market is expected to rank
                    among the global top three by increasing growth and is
                    supposed to be the 6th largest market in the world with
                    respect to absolute size. <br /> <br /> The term clinical

                    and beyond. Once the promising molecule is identified in the
                    lab, it is subjected to more per-clinical studies to get an
                    idea about different aspects of the test article. Clinical
                    research is often conducted at academic medical centers and

                    <br /> Many believe that informed consent makes clinical

                      Resources of Grammar and Expression. They are assessed on
                      a scale from 0 to 6. Clinical communication criteria

                      level of performance on all nine criteria is required in
                      order to achieve a score of 350 (previously grade B) on
